    """ Read lines from text files

    Parameters
    ----------
    urlpath : string or list
        Absolute or relative filepath(s). Prefix with a protocol like ``s3://``
        to read from alternative filesystems. To read from multiple files you
        can pass a globstring or a list of paths, with the caveat that they
        must all have the same protocol.
    blocksize: None, int, or str
        Size (in bytes) to cut up larger files.  Streams by default.
        Can be ``None`` for streaming, an integer number of bytes, or a string
        like "128MiB"
    compression: string
        Compression format like 'gzip' or 'xz'.  Defaults to 'infer'
    encoding: string
    errors: string
    linedelimiter: string
    collection: bool, optional
        Return dask.bag if True, or list of delayed values if false
    storage_options: dict
        Extra options that make sense to a particular storage connection, e.g.
        host, port, username, password, etc.
    files_per_partition: None or int
        If set, group input files into partitions of the requested size,
        instead of one partition per file. Mutually exclusive with blocksize.
    include_path: bool
        Whether or not to include the path in the bag.
        If true, elements are tuples of (line, path).
        Default is False.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> b = read_text('myfiles.1.txt')  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> b = read_text('myfiles.*.txt')  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> b = read_text('myfiles.*.txt.gz')  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> b = read_text('s3://bucket/myfiles.*.txt')  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> b = read_text('s3://key:secret@bucket/myfiles.*.txt')  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> b = read_text('hdfs://namenode.example.com/myfiles.*.txt')  # doctest: +SKIP

    Parallelize a large file by providing the number of uncompressed bytes to
    load into each partition.

    >>> b = read_text('largefile.txt', blocksize='10MB')  # doctest: +SKIP

    Get file paths of the bag by setting include_path=True

    >>> b = read_text('myfiles.*.txt', include_path=True) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> b.take(1) # doctest: +SKIP
    (('first line of the first file', '/home/dask/myfiles.0.txt'),)

    Returns
    -------
    dask.bag.Bag or list
        dask.bag.Bag if collection is True or list of Delayed lists otherwise.
